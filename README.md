# gptcomplete
A rudimentary autocomplete service using ChatGPT. 

GPT-4 is definitely a better auto-completer than 3.5 turbo. The response time is way too slow for this to be an actual application.

Usage:
Download and open in a browser.
You need to provide your own API key. Runs client side only. Code is kept at an absolute minimum to promote transparancy.
